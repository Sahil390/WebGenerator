# Netlify Function Fix Summary

## What was fixed:

### 1. **Removed duplicate code** in `generate-website.js`
- Your original file had the same logic repeated twice, causing variable redeclaration errors
- This would break the function when deployed to Netlify

### 2. **Improved error handling**
- Added proper timeout handling for AI generation
- Added retry logic with fallback prompts
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios

### 3. **Memory management**
- Added cleanup of AI response objects to prevent memory leaks
- Added garbage collection hints for Node.js

### 4. **Enhanced functionality**
- Primary generation attempt with 2.5 minute timeout
- Fallback generation attempt with simplified prompt if primary fails
- Better response processing with timeout protection

## Current Configuration:

### File Structure ✅
```
netlify/
├── functions/
│   ├── generate-website.js ✅ (Fixed - no duplicates)
│   ├── health.js ✅ (Working)
│   └── package.json ✅ (Dependencies correct)
```

### Netlify Configuration ✅
- `netlify.toml` is properly configured
- Function timeout set to 300 seconds
- Memory limit set to 1024 MB
- CORS headers configured
- API redirects working (`/api/*` → `/.netlify/functions/*`)

### Dependencies ✅
- `@google/generative-ai` v0.2.1 installed in functions
- All React dependencies properly configured

## To Deploy to Netlify:

### 1. **Build the project**
```bash
npm run build
```
*(Already confirmed working)*

### 2. **Set Environment Variables in Netlify**
Go to your Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables and add:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` = your_actual_gemini_api_key_here

### 3. **Deploy**
Your project should now work correctly on Netlify!

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Fixed the main issue**: Removed duplicate code that was causing variable redeclaration errors
2. **Improved reliability**: Added timeout and retry logic
3. **Better error handling**: More descriptive error messages for users
4. **Memory optimization**: Proper cleanup of AI response objects

## API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/generate-website` - Generate website from prompt
- `GET /api/health` - Check API status

## How it works:
1. Frontend sends POST request to `/api/generate-website`
2. Netlify redirects to `/.netlify/functions/generate-website`
3. Function processes request with Gemini AI
4. Returns generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
5. Frontend displays the result

Your project should now work the same way on Netlify as it does locally!
