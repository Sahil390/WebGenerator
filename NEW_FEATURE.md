    # New Feature: Open Generated Website in New Tab

## üöÄ What's New?

We've added a new **"Open in New Tab"** button that allows users to open their generated website in a completely separate browser tab/window.

## üéØ Feature Details

### Location
- The new button appears in the `PreviewSection` component
- It's prominently displayed as a primary action button with gradient styling
- Located above the existing Preview, Export, and Share buttons

### Functionality
- **Primary Method**: Creates a blob URL from the generated HTML and opens it in a new tab
- **Fallback Method**: If pop-up blockers prevent the new tab, it falls back to the existing preview method
- **User Feedback**: Shows success/fallback notifications via toast messages
- **Memory Management**: Automatically cleans up blob URLs after the window loads

### Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified:
1. **`src/components/PreviewSection.tsx`**:
   - Added `ExternalLink` icon import
   - Added `onOpenInNewTab` prop to interface
   - Redesigned button layout (2-column grid with prominent new button)
   - Moved share button to separate row

2. **`src/pages/Index.tsx`**:
   - Added `handleOpenInNewTab()` function
   - Integrated with existing toast notification system
   - Added fallback to existing preview method

3. **`server/index.js`**:
   - Updated CORS configuration to support multiple development ports

#### Key Features:
- **Blob URL Creation**: Converts HTML string to downloadable blob
- **Pop-up Handling**: Graceful fallback if browser blocks pop-ups
- **Window Management**: Sets proper title and cleans up resources
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback through toast notifications

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. User generates a website using AI
2. Generated website appears in the preview section
3. User clicks "Open in New Tab" button
4. System creates a blob URL from the HTML content
5. Opens the blob URL in a new browser tab/window
6. Cleans up the blob URL automatically after 1 second

## üé® UI/UX Improvements

- **Prominent Placement**: The new button uses gradient styling to stand out
- **Better Layout**: Reorganized button grid for better hierarchy
- **Clear Icons**: Uses `ExternalLink` icon for intuitive understanding
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains responsive layout across all screen sizes

## üîß Technical Benefits

- **No Server Dependencies**: Works entirely client-side
- **Memory Efficient**: Automatic cleanup of blob URLs
- **Browser Compatible**: Works across all modern browsers
- **Fallback Safe**: Graceful degradation if features are blocked

## üì± User Journey

1. **Generate**: User describes their website and clicks generate
2. **Preview**: Website appears in the integrated preview iframe
3. **Open**: User clicks "Open in New Tab" for full-screen experience
4. **Browse**: Website opens in a separate tab as a standalone application
5. **Export**: User can still download or share the website

This feature significantly improves the user experience by allowing full interaction with generated websites in their own browser environment!
